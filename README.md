# Descriptoon
This project is a simple exam score sheet web app with basic data handling. The web app allows users to present, add and delete results. Results can be filtered based on the grade the students are in and based on the scores they acheived in the exam.

## Getting Started

In order to get started with the application you will need to:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run "npm i" to install all dependancies for the app
3. Run "npm start" to run the application in development mode on port 3000

The app initiates with three results stored in the state by default, this has been done for simplicity purposes and in the future we can look into building an API with database to store all scores.
